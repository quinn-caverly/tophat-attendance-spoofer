# tophat-attendance-spoofer

Automatically answers questions for participation credit on Tophat. Run the program at some point before the class starts and login to tophat. Navigate to the course's homepage and attendance questions will automatically be answered as they appear. 

_I have never and never would use this program or a similar one in a way which would violate the rules of the Pennsylvania State University or the syllabi of its classes._
